# pteron keyboard
An ergonomic keyboard heavily inspired by the [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus), [Iris](https://github.com/keebio/iris-case) and [Atreis](https://github.com/dekonnection/atreis) keyboards.

The name *Pteron* is the Ancient greek word for wing (and feather). This was inspired by *Chiroptera*, the scientific name (or order) of bats.
> The name “Chiroptera” derives from Ancient Greek: χείρ – cheir, “hand” and πτερόν – pteron, “wing”.

## Laser cutting
The default switch plate is designed for laser cutting with a kerf of 0.1 mm. The switch holes are designed for Cherry MX style switches, and should allow for switch top removal on both Cherry MX/Gateron/etc. and Kailh BOX switches. 

There is an alternative switch plate with square holes (`case/switch-plate-square-holes.svg`), which does not allow switch top opening, but which might add some stability to the switches.

I would recommend using 3 mm thick acrylic for stiffness, which means that the switches have to be glued in, since Cherry MX-style switches are designed for a plate thickness of ~1.5 mm.

## Design
The initial inspiration was the [Atreis](https://github.com/dekonnection/atreis) keyboard, but I wanted some more stagger on the ring and pinky fingers. I ended up with a stagger of -0.7 u for the two outer columns, followed by -0.2 u, 0, -0.3 u and -0.4 u. I also removed the top thumb key, and added a key to the thumb cluster.
