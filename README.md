An ergonomic keyboard heavily inspired by the [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus), [Iris](https://github.com/keebio/iris-case) and [Atreis](https://github.com/dekonnection/atreis) keyboards.

## Laser cutting
The switch plate is designed for laser cutting using a kerf of 0.1 mm. The switch holes are designed for Cherry MX style switches, and should allow for switch top removal on both Cherry MX/Gateron/etc. and Kailh BOX switches. 

I would recommend using 3 mm thick acrylic for stiffness, which means that the switches have to be glued in, since Cherry MX-style switches are designed for a plate thickness of ~1.5 mm.

## TODO
 - Add screw holes in the plates
